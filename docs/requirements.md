# Requirements

python-makemkv requires Python 3.9 or later.

Additionally, a copy of MakeMKV is required, which can be downloaded
from their [website](https://www.makemkv.com/). If MakeMKV isn't installed at the default location, you also need to ensure
that `makemkvcon` can be run from the terminal, e. g. by adding its
location to your PATH environment variable.
